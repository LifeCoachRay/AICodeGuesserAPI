This is a program that has a list of secret codes. You can try to guess what they are. If you guess correctly, the program will tell you that you guessed correctly. If you guess incorrectly, the program will tell you to try again.

To use this program, you need to have a computer with a special program called "node" installed. Then, you can run the program by typing a command into the terminal.

The program will start a special server that you can send messages to using another program on your computer. You can send a message with your guess of the secret code by sending a "POST" request to the server with the guess in the body of the request. The server will respond with a message telling you if your guess was correct or not.
